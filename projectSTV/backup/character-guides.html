      <h2>Killer Guide: The Basics</h2>
      <p>Step into the Fog and embrace the darkness. As a Killer in Dead by Daylight, you are the hunter — relentless, cunning, and feared. But power alone isn’t enough to claim victory. Each Killer has their own strengths, weaknesses, and unique playstyle that can turn the tide of a trial.</p>
      <p>This guide will walk you through the essentials: strategies, perks, and tips to sharpen your claws and perfect your hunt.</p>

      <h3>Hooks</h3>
      <p>Hooks are the core of your objective as a Killer...</p>

      <h3>Generator Control</h3>
      <p>Survivors win by repairing five generators, so your top priority is slowing their progress...</p>

      <h3>Chases</h3>
      <p>A good chase is about efficiency. The longer you spend chasing one Survivor...</p>

      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>Playing Killer is about balance: managing hook pressure, slowing generators, and ending chases quickly...</p>

      <h2>Survivor Guide: The Basics</h2>
      <p>In the endless Fog of Dead by Daylight, survival is never guaranteed. As a Survivor, you are not the hunter — you are the hunted. Every heartbeat, every snap of a twig, every shadow behind you could mean the difference between life and death.</p>
      <p>This guide will prepare you for the fight to survive: from mastering stealth and completing generators, to learning when to flee and when to fight for your teammates.</p>

      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <p>Your main goal is to repair five generators to power the exit gates and escape...</p>

      <h3>Stealth and Map Awareness</h3>
      <p>Staying hidden is crucial. Use obstacles, pallets, and the environment to break line-of-sight...</p>

      <h3>Chases and Loops</h3>
      <p>If the Killer spots you, running isn’t always the best strategy — smart use of loops and pallets can waste their time...</p>

      <h3>Helping Teammates</h3>
      <p>Survivors are stronger together. Healing downed teammates, unhooking others, and cooperating on generator repairs can turn the tide of the match...</p>

      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>Playing Survivor is about strategy, awareness, and adaptability...</p>
